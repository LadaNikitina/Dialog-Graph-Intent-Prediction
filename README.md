# Reimagining Intent Prediction: Insights from Graph-Based Dialogue Modeling and Sentence Encoders

## Overview
This repository presents the implementation of a novel approach designed specifically for closed-domain dialogue systems. The method, as detailed in the accompanying research paper, uses scenario dialogue graphs to address the challenges inherent in closed-domain dialogue systems, where a nuanced understanding of context is essential. The focus is on achieving accurate intent prediction, representing a significant advance in dialogue system capabilities.
